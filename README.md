# Fan-Speed-Controller-with-Temperature
This repository implements a temperature-controlled fan system using an ATmega32 microcontroller. The project includes drivers for ADC, GPIO, LCD, Temperature Sensor, DC-Motor, and PWM. The layered architecture ensures modularity and ease of understanding. The fan speed is dynamically adjusted based on temperature, displayed on an LCD.
